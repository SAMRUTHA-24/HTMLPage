<p>In the tapestry of my life, I am Samrutha, a spirited soul born on August 24, 2002, in the picturesque town of Palakkad. Hailing from a humble background, my journey has been marked by resilience, dreams, and the unwavering support of my family. Growing up in a close-knit community, I discovered early on the value of hard work and perseverance.
  From the corridors of my modest home to the vibrant playgrounds of my youth, I found solace and joy in the pursuit of my passions. Aiming high, I set my sights on becoming a software engineer, a dream that fuels my every endeavor. Beyond the realm of coding and algorithms, I found fulfillment in the camaraderie of sports, particularly throwball, where the thrill of competition and teamwork captivates me.
  Not confined to one domain, I am also an athlete, sprinting towards my goals on and off the track. Along this journey, my parents emerged as pillars of strength, navigating the challenges of life with me. Their unwavering support, coupled with the encouragement of cherished friends, has been my greatest asset.
  As the chapters of my autobiography unfold, I am filled with gratitude for the experiences that have shaped me. Join me in this narrative, where the pages are adorned with dreams, resilience, and the indomitable spirit of Samrutha.</p>
